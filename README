Install
=======

Hemera depends on the following libraries:

 * ply 2.3 (or superior)
 * pygraphviz (or superior)


Ply: this library is easy to install, the library can be founded in
lib subdirectory.

Pygraphviz: in the past, it was a little bit more complicated!! But it
seems that from now on we just need to run:

easy_install pygraphviz


PyGraphviz: old installation procedure
======================================

In the past, for Mac OS system we have followed the procedure discribed in:
http://groups.google.com/group/pygraphviz-discuss/browse_thread/thread/f3b385409bb66420?pli=1

The pygraphviz library in lib directory was downloaded from
http://networkx.lanl.gov/download/pygraphviz/

And the graphviz package from:
http://graphviz.org/pub/graphviz/development/macos/leopard/

Finnaly, we edited the setup.py from the pygraphviz adding the correct
location of libraries (in the beggining of the file):

# Mac OS X (pkg from ATT)
library_path='/usr/local/lib'
include_path='/usr/local/include/graphviz'


Pending
=======

1. The initial sequent should be listed before cleaning the goals. 
2. Improve the parser to consider cases like "a --> a --> a". 


Making the distro
=================

python setup.py sdist
